# LOS Simple Profile Switcher
This little app adds just one quicksettings tile. Clicking it cycles through available system profiles. Uses [Cyanogen Platform SDK](https://github.com/CyanogenMod/cm_platform_sdk) and will work **only** on LineageOS roms.

I've really missed the tile that toggled lockscreen lock ever since it was removed in... some old Cyanogenmod version. You can change lockscreen mode with system profiles, but profile switcher was also removed (from tiles and power menu), which sucks. I finally decided to do something about it.

For some time I tried using [this app](https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/app-profiles-quicksettings-tile-t3665913), but I found it inconvenient because every time you have to select a profile from list and confirm. Also I don't need a widget doing the same thing.

I should've done it sooner - it's literally like 30 lines of code.
